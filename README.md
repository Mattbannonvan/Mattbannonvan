👋 Welcome to My Digital Playground! 🎉
Hi there, I'm MattBannon-van
This is where I tinker with code, experiment with new ideas, and occasionally break things. 🤓💥
What You'll Find Here:
 * 💻 Code Experiments: Pet projects, coding challenges, and random snippets I'm proud of.
 * 🌱 Learning Journey: Notes, resources, and tutorials documenting my coding adventures.
 * 🚀 Side Quests: Fun projects, game jams, or whatever else catches my fancy.
I'm Currently Exploring:
 * 🐍 Python: My go-to language for most things.
 * 🕸️ Web Development: Building cool stuff for the web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
 * 🤖 AI/ML:  Dipping my toes into the world of machine learning.
Let's Connect!
